### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the marketing metrics of a company across their social media platforms. By analyzing various aspects of the marketing data, I identified the trends, made data driven recommendations and gained a deeper understanding on the digital marketing performance across platforms.

### Data Sources

Marketing Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "marketing.csv" file, containing detailed information about the total budget spent, total revenue generated and customer behaviour.

### Tools

- Excel- Data cleaning & Analysis
- Powerbi- Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I perfomed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & Inspection
2. Handling missing values 
3. Data cleaning & formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the marketing data to answer key questions such as:

- What is the Return on marketing investment (ROMI)?
- What is the Cost per click (CPC)
- What is the Cost per lead (CPL)
- What is the Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- What is the Average order value (AOV)
- What is the Conversion rate 1
- What is the Conversion rate 2

### Data Analysis

- SUM(CAC)
- SUM(REVENUE)

### Results/Findings

The analsis results are summarized as follows:
1. The top 3 campaign names that generated the highest revenues were:
YouTube blogs 
Instagram blogs
Instagram teir 1
2. Revenue was generated most during Weekdays
3. In the sum of revenue by date the most revenue was generated on February 21, 2011

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions;
- Invest in promoting more youtube blogs
- Running more campaign ads targeted for during weekday
- Adopt an advanced customer segmentation model to prioritize high-LTV segments,
  enabling personalized campaigns and maximizing long-term profitability

### Limitations

The segmentation and visualization were performed using available tools such as Excel and Power BI, 
which may limit the depth of predictive insights compared to advanced machine learning models.
